<h4 style="color:#F09789">Extraction</h4>

We extracted two data sets from different sources. Our first data set from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/iamsouravbanerjee/covid19-dataset-world-and-continent-wise?select=Covid+Data+-+World.csv" target="_blank" style="color:#6990A4">Kaggle</a> contained several CSVs with Covid data from across the world including total cases, deaths and recoveries. We chose to focus on North America for this process due to time constraints. Our second data set was sourced from <a href="https://covidactnow.org/?s=23261246" target="_blank" style="color:#6990A4">CovidActNow</a> which contains vaccination progress by states across the United States. We wanted to see how vaccination rates are effecting hospitalization rates.
